- Created models to identify high-density population areas with inconsistent grid access
- Predicted which customers to target with specific products
- Identified new markets for expansion

**Technology Used**:
- Atlas AI platform
- Google Cloud
- Geospatial AI

**Results**:
- 48% increase in monthly sales in AI-targeted regions compared to traditional marketing
- Hyperlocal predictions enabled targeted marketing
- Expected business increase in Africa of over $100 million annually

## Case Study 2: Duke Energy
**Context**: Achieving net-zero methane emissions by 2030 by detecting and fixing natural gas pipeline leaks

**ML Application**:
- AI system to assess data from satellite monitoring and ground-level sensors
- Near real-time reporting of methane leaks
- Prioritization of leak repairs

**Technology Used**:
- Microsoft Azure
- Dynamics 365
- Implementation by Accenture and Avenade

**Results**:
- Graphic dashboards to quantify and prioritize measurements
- Geolocation data allowed crews to pinpoint and fix leaks more quickly
- Scalable system adaptable to other equipment and types of emissions

## Case Study 3: Marathon Oil
**Context**: Creating intelligent alerts for changing conditions at nearly 4,000 wells

**ML Application**:
- Applied AI and analytics to time-series production data
- Automated investigation of issues and alert generation
- Task assignment for field checks
